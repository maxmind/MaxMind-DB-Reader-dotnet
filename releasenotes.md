# Release Notes #

## 4.2.0

* .NET 6.0 and .NET 7.0 have been removed as targets as they have both
  reach their end of support from Microsoft. If you are using these versions,
  the .NET Standard 2.1 target should continue working for you.
* .NET 9.0 has been added as a target.
* We now use a mutex rather than a lock statement when opening the
  database. This is done to reduce the likelihood of a race condition
  when process are opening a single database when using
  `FileAccessMode.MemoryMappedGlobal`.
* Performance improvements. Pull requests by Gr√©goire. GitHub #210, #211
  and #212.

## 4.1.0 (2023-12-05) ##

* .NET 5.0 has been removed as a target as it has reach its end of life.
  However, if you are using .NET 5.0, the .NET Standard 2.1 target should
  continue working for you.
* .NET 7.0 and .NET 8.0 have been added as a target.
* Minor performance improvements.

## 4.0.0 (2022-02-03) ##

* This library no longer targets .NET 4.6.1.
* .NET 6.0 was added as a target.

## 3.0.0 (2020-11-16) ##

* This library now requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or greater or .NET Standard
  2.0 or greater.
* .NET 5.0 was added as a target framework.
* When decoding strings in a memory-mapped file, the reader no longer
  allocates a temporary `byte[]`. This significantly improves performance but
  requires the use of `unsafe` code.
* `FileAccessMode.MemoryMapped` now works if the database path specified is
  a symbolic link to the actual database.

## 2.6.1 (2019-12-06) ##

* `netstandard2.1` was added as a target framework.

## 2.6.0 (2019-12-06) ##

* This library has been updated to support the nullable reference types
  introduced in C# 8.0.

## 2.5.0 (2019-11-21) ##

* A `FindAll` method was added to the `MaxMind.Db.Reader` class. This returns
  an enumerator that enumerates over the MaxMind DB database. Pull request by
  Jeff Johnson. GitHub #47.
* A `CreateAsync` static method was added to asynchronously created a
  `MaxMind.Db.Reader` object from database file. Pull request by David
  Warner. GitHub #44.
* When deserializing to a class, you may now instruct the reader to set a
  constructor parameter to be the network associated with the record. To do
  this, use the `Network` attribute. The parameter must be of type
  `MaxMind.Db.Network`. GitHub #56.
* As part of #44, the optimization to reduce allocations when loading from
  a seekable stream was removed. The optimization could cause poor
  performance in some instances and its behavior with regard to the stream
  position differed from the documented behavior.

## 2.4.0 (2018-04-11) ##

* Added `FileAccessMode.MemoryMappedGlobal`. When used, this will open the file
  in global memory map mode. This requires the "create global objects" right.
  Pull request by David Warner. GitHub #43.

## 2.3.0 (2017-10-27) ##

* Reduce the number of allocations when creating a `MaxMind.Db.Reader` from
  a seekable stream. Pull request by Maarten Balliauw. GitHub #38.
* A `netstandard2.0` target was added to eliminate additional dependencies
  required by the `netstandard1.4` target. Pull request by Adeel Mujahid.
  GitHub #39.
* As part of the above work, the separate Mono build files were dropped. As
  of Mono 5.0.0, `msbuild` is supported.

## 2.2.0 (2017-05-08) ##

* Switch to the updated MSBuild .NET Core build system. Pull request by Adeel
  Mujahid. GitHub #35.
* Move tests from  NUnit to xUnit.net. GitHub #35.

## 2.1.3 (2016-11-22) ##

* Update for .NET Core 1.1.

## 2.1.2 (2016-08-08) ##

* Re-build of 2.1.1 to fix signing issue. No code changes.

## 2.1.1 (2016-08-01) ##

* First non-beta release with .NET Core support.
* The tests now use the .NET Core NUnit runner.

## 2.1.1-beta1 (2016-06-01) ##

* Re-release of `2.1.0-beta4` to skip bad `2.1.0` release on NuGet.

## 2.1.0-beta4 (2016-06-01) ##

* Update for .NET Core RC2. Pull request by Adeel Mujahid. GitHub #28.

## 2.1.0-beta3 (2016-05-12) ##

* The assemblies are now signed again.

## 2.1.0-beta2 (2016-05-10) ##

* Remove unnecessary Newtonsoft.Json dependency.

## 2.1.0-beta1 (2016-05-10) ##

* .NET Core support. Switched to `dotnet/cli` for building. Pull request by
  Adeel Mujahid. GitHub #26 & #27.

## 2.0.0 (2016-04-15) ##

* No changes since 2.0.0-beta3.

## 2.0.0-beta3 (2016-03-24) ##

* The Reader class now has an overloaded method that takes an integer out
  parameter. This parameter is set the the network prefix length for the
  record containing the IP address in the database. Pull request by Ed Dorsey.
  GitHub #22 & #23.

## 2.0.0-beta2 (2016-01-29) ##

* Minor refactoring. No substantial changes since beta1.

## 2.0.0-beta1 (2016-01-18) ##

* Significant API changes. The `Find` method now takes a type parameter
  specifying the type to deserialize to. Note that `JToken` is _not_ supported
  for this. You can either deserialize to an arbitrary collection or to
  model classes that use the `MaxMind.Db.Constructor` and
  `MaxMind.Db.Parameter` attributes to identify the constructors and
  parameters to deserialize to.
* The API now significantly faster.

## 1.2.0 (2015-09-23) ##

* Production release. No changes.

## 1.2.0-beta1 (2015-09-08) ##

* The assembly now has a strong name.
* An internal use of `JTokenReader` is now disposed of after use.
* A null stream passed to the `Reader(Stream)` constructor will now throw an
  `ArgumentNullException`.

## 1.1.0 (2015-07-21) ##

* Minor code cleanup.

## 1.1.0-beta1 (2015-06-30) ##

* A `IOException: Not enough storage is available to process this command`
  when using the memory-mapped mode with 32-bit builds or many threads was
  fixed. Closes GH #5.
* Use of streams was replaced with direct access for both the memory-mapped
  file mode and the memory mode. This should increase performance in most
  cases.
* When using memory-mapped mode, the file is now opened with
  `FileShare.Delete`, allowing other processes to delete or replace the
  database when it is in use. The reader object will continue using the old
  database.
* The Json.NET dependency was updated to 7.0.1.

## 1.0.1 (2015-05-19) ##

* Improved the exception thrown when the constructor for `Reader` is called
  with an empty stream.
* Updated Newtonsoft.Json dependency to 6.0.8.
* Minor code cleanup.

## 1.0.0 (2014-09-29) ##

* First production release.

## 0.3.0 (2014-09-24) ##

* Added public `Metadata` property on `Reader`.

## 0.2.3 (2014-04-09) ##

* The database is now loadable from a `Stream`.

## 0.2.2 (2013-12-24) ##

* Fixed a bug that occurred when using the memory-mode in a multi-threaded
  application. When using a single `Reader` from multiple threads in memory-
  mode, the internal state of the object could become corrupt if you replaced
  the MaxMind database file on disk with another database file.

## 0.2.1 (2013-11-15) ##

* Fixed bug that caused an exception to be thrown when two threads created a
  `MaxMind.Db.Reader` object at the same time. This was fixed using a
  synchronization lock around the code that opens/creates the memory map. We
  recommend that you share a `Reader` object across threads rather than
  create one for each thread or lookup.

## 0.2.0 (2013-10-25) ##

* Changed namespace from `MaxMind.DB` to `MaxMind.Db` to conform with
  Microsoft's recommendations.
* Replaced custom `BigInteger` implementation with
  `System.Numerics.BigInteger`.
* Made `Metadata` an internal property on `Reader`.

## 0.1.0 (2013-10-22) ##

* Initial release
